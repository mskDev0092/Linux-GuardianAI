DISCLAIMER FOR GUARDIANAI

While GuardianAI is provided in the hope that it will be useful, the following
additional disclaimers apply specifically to this security and system administration tool:

1. SYSTEM MODIFICATION RISK:
   This software executes system commands and modifications. Improper use could
   result in data loss, system instability, or security vulnerabilities. Always
   review commands before execution and maintain regular backups.

2. AI GENERATION DISCLAIMER:
   Commands and suggestions generated by AI models are provided "as-is" without
   guarantee of correctness, safety, or security. AI can make mistakes. Always
   verify generated commands independently before execution.

3. SECURITY LIMITATION:
   This software is a monitoring and assistance tool, not a complete security solution.
   It should be used as part of a comprehensive security strategy, not as your only
   defense against threats.

4. NO WARRANTY FOR LOCAL AI MODELS:
   The performance and reliability of local AI models (LMStudio, Jan.ai, etc.)
   are not guaranteed by this software's developers. Third-party AI tools are
   used at your own risk.

5. PRIVILEGE ESCALATION:
   This software may request elevated privileges (sudo/admin). Only grant
   permissions you trust, and ensure your system is properly configured for
   secure privilege escalation.

6. LIABILITY:
   In no event shall the authors be liable for any special, indirect, incidental,
   or consequential damages arising out of or related to this License or the use
   or inability to use the Software, including but not limited to:
   - Data loss or corruption
   - System downtime or instability
   - Security breaches or compromises
   - Any other damages or losses

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

For professional system administration, always consult with certified system
administrators and security experts.
