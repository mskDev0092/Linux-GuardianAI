## ⚙️ Configuration

### Setting Up Local AI

GuardianAI works best with local AI models for maximum privacy and speed.

#### Option 1: LMStudio (Recommended)

1. Download [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Load a model (e.g., Qwen-12B)
3. Start the server (default: `http://localhost:1234`)
4. GuardianAI will auto-detect it

#### Option 2: Jan.ai

1. Download [Jan.ai](https://jan.ai)
2. Start a local model server
3. Configure the endpoint in GuardianAI settings

#### Option 3: Cloud API (Fallback)

If local AI isn't available, you can use:

- OpenAI API
- Anthropic Claude
- Other OpenAI-compatible APIs

Set your API key in the application settings.
